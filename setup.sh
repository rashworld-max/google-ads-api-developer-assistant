# Description:
#   This script initializes the development environment for the Google Ads API Developer Assistant.
#   It performs the following steps:
#   1. Verifies that required tools (jq, git) are installed.
#   2. Clones or updates the 'google-ads-python' repository into a specified directory.
#   3. Updates the '.gemini/settings.json' file to include the project's API examples,
#      saved code, and the cloned Python library in the context.
#   4. Registers the project as a Gemini extension.

# Exit on any error, and on undefined variables.
